                <p class="smaller">This is my favorite image that I have taken during Photo 20 so far. This wasn't exactly a shot I 
                    expected to shoot. It was a cold winter day, and I went out with Matviy to take a couple pictures for an assignment. My 
                    intention for taking this picture was to kind of just test out the shutterspeed of the camera and look at the snow falling. 
                    After taking the shot, I liked how it captured the snow falling, and the cars parked looked really cool aswell. The shot kind of just had
                    this almost winter wonderland aesthetic, which I found looked awesome.

                <p class="smaller">This is my favorite image that I took for my composition assignment. I enjoyed taking pictures that utilized framing
                    as it exemplifed the feeling of loneliness or singularity in my pictures(I dug the unique aesthetic that it created). I took this shot using
                    an army guy action figure and a piece of black construction paper that I rolled up to create a tunnel/the frame. I chose black construction paper in this case
                    because it allowed me to create a darker/gloomier environment for my image, and matched some of the shots that inspired this shot. The shot that mostly
                    inspired this shot was a man in a train tunnel, I really liked the isolated feeling of lonliness that this shot created.

                <p class="smaller">This is the image I created for my "Am I talking to myself" assignment. This image was inspired by the 
                    multiple spidermans pointing at eachother meme, but instead of the spidermans I choose to use people with cameras, in this context,
                    paparazzi. I also decided to use a centralized subject, and what would make the most sense in this context, A CELEBRITY! I
                    put my celebrity character in a different colored shirt, which caused him to be the center of attention. Additionally I utilized rule of thirds
                    to make the celebrity stand out even more from the other clones.

                <p class="smaller">This is the image I created for the double expsure assignment. When shooting my portrait image, I decided to go for
                    short lighting as I saw many example images utilize a similar lighting setup. For the editng part of this assignment I started 
                    by experimenting with different images to "double exposure", I started with a mountain, but I couldn't exactly get it right, I messed around with trees,
                    but that didn't sit right either, then I landed on what I decided to use, a bush. I found this really cool pink bush image, and it was high quality and worked perfectly with my image.
                    I noticed that certain colors blended better with the portrait image, and pink was one of the better ones. Editing the edges of the bush was one of the
                    hardest parts, but I managed to pull it off.

                    This macro photography assignment was a really fun assignment. I enjoyed using my creativity to create a variety of macro shots,
                    and using different lenses for different shots was an interesting experience. I'll start by talking about my experience with the kit
                    lens, this lens is byfar one of most versitile lens for taking photos; however, this lens is not specifically created for
                    macro photography. Therefore it is a little bit of a struggle to create macro shots with intense depth of field as the aperature doesn't
                    go as low as the others. Next I will talk about the prime lenses, 50mm and 90mm. The 90mm was probably the best macro photography lens I've
                    used to date, the lens is phenominal; it's aperature is perfect, and it zooms in a solid amount to create a good macro effect. On the other hand the
                    50mm prime lens while being designed for some macro photography and featuring a wide aperature, it doesn't zoom in as much as other lenses like the
                    90mm prime lens; for this reason, using this lens is a little bit of a pain, it's a constant struggle to find a google angle and get close enough but not
                    too close to maintain focus. This lens overall is great for other types of photography, but it isn't the best for macro in my honest opinion.

                    For this assignment we were asked to create a product photography shot of any product we wanted. I chose to take a photograph of 
                    a Dell mouse, as it provided ample opportunity to experiment with a variety of backgrounds and setups. I also thought that it was
                    generally just a cool product to photograph. I went with a black background to enphasize a colorscheme and possibly include a bit
                    of moderness or luxury into my shot. The texture of the background also complimented the smoothness of the mouse. For my lens I went with a 
                    90mm prime, as it provided a good amount of depth of field as well as a clear close up shot of my product. In terms of lighting, 
                    I chose to experiment with a variety of lights; in the end I went with a singular light which was aimed a little away from my product. 
                    Although, I did experiment with different colored lights, which also gave a good result.
